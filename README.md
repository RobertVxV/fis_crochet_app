### General Description:
This application aims to help crochet artists create and share their designs by offering special tools to make written patterns easier to both read and write. Users also gain the ability to browse and buy designs that others decided to share.

### Registration:
The user needs to register into application by selecting a unique username and password.

### Main page:
After the user logs in, they will be welcomed by a list of buttons:
1.  ‘New Design’ -> The designer can name and price the pattern, decide the difficulty level and make it public. After that they will be sent to the “Edit Design” section.
2.	‘My Designs’ -> A list of designs made by the logged in user will be displayed. By clicking on a design, the user will be sent to their Edit design page.
3.	‘Browse Designs’ ->  The user can search for designs for the displayed window.
4.	‘Liked Designs’ -> A list of designs liked by this user.
5.	‘Logout’ -> Sends the user back to the login page.

### Edit Design:
- The user can define the kinds of stitches the project will use by giving them an abbreviation and a description of the stitch.
- Next, the user will be presented with buttons to add a stitch, view the already defined stitches, add a row, a textbox or a photo to a design.
- A row is a textbox that can work with stitches.
- At the end of each row, each type of stitch will be counted and a total number of stitches per row will be calculated and displayed. The rows will be displayed in numerical order.
- The user will be able to insert pictures and text boxes and row boxes at any step of the pattern.

### Browse designs:
- All browsable designs can be liked by clicking on a Button on their view.
- Once a pattern is liked, the pattern is sent to the user’s ‘liked designs’ list, and the number of likes that design has is increased.
- Browsable designs can be sorted by rating, no. of likes, price or difficulty level. They can be sorted both ascending or descending.
- Once the user clicks on a design, they can read the ratings from other buyers of that design by pressing a button.
- There will also be a button for buying the pattern. Once clicked, it will send the buyer to the "Buy Design" page.

### Buy Designs:
The user will be prompted to decide how they are going to pay: by card or by vouchers.

### Card payment:
The user will be prompted to insert a valid card with a valid ccv. If everything goes well, money will be taken out of that card and added in the designer’s account. The buyer will have access to the design now.

### Voucher payment:
The user will be prompted to insert a valid voucher code. If its value is greater than the price, the buyer will have access to the design now.

### Liked designs:
- Liked designs can be unliked by pressing the heart near them. A window saying ‘Are you sure to remove this pattern from the liked list’ will pop up. If the user presses the ‘Yes’ button, the design will be removed from the liked list and the number of likes that design has will be decreased.
- Users will only have access to the free written patterns or patterns they have bought or created. 
- Users can only write reviews for patterns they can view, and they are not the creator of.
